Animated Gif Wallpaper
====================

Simple Java app to let you set animated GIFs as wallpaper (Mac only).

Just download the .app file (save it to your Applications folder if you want), then launch the app and drag-and-drop your GIF... that's it!

Note: this is still a bit buggy, and may crash if you try to change files while running. Quit and relaunch should solve this :)
